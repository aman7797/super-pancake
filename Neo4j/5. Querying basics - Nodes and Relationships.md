# Querying basics - Nodes and Relationships

## Match

The `MATCH` clause allows you to specify the patterns Neo4j will search for in the database

The symbol `--` means related to, without regard to type or direction of the relationship.

```
MATCH (anything) RETURN anything LIMIT 5
```

- *anything* - is the variable in which output is going to be saved.
- *RETURN* - returns the variable/output
- *LIMIT* - to show the limited output


![Match Query 1](/img/match1.png)

```
MATCH (output:Person) RETURN output LIMIT 5
```

- *output* - is the variable in which output is going to be saved.
- *:Person* - is to get nodes with the tag `Person`
- *RETURN* - returns the variable/output
- *LIMIT* - to show the limited output

## Match Relationship

```
MATCH (node1)--(node2) RETURN node1, node2 LIMIT 2
```

The query defines if there are related nodes with any relations will be printed.

![Match Query 1](/img/match3.png)

```
MATCH (node1)-[rel]->(node2) 
RETURN node1, rel, node2 
LIMIT 1
```

*rel* - describes any relation in between the nodes 

![Match Query 1](/img/match4.png)

```
MATCH (node1)-[rel:DIRECTED]->(node2) 
RETURN node1, rel, node2 
LIMIT 1
```

In the above example rel type is described as DIRECTED. So it will show the output for the particular relation.

![Match Query 1](/img/match5.png)

```
MATCH (actor:Person)-[rel:DIRECTED]->(movie:Movie) 
RETURN actor, rel, movie 
LIMIT 1
```

here we have declared the type of nodes, in which between we wanted the output.

![Match Query 1](/img/match6.png)

```
MATCH (actor:Person)-[rel:DIRECTED | ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie) 
RETURN actor, rel, movie 
LIMIT 10
```

if we have multiple relation filter we can do it like this

## Optional Match

```
MATCH (output:Movie)
RETURN output
```

It helps to retrive all movie nodes

![Match Query 1](/img/match8.png)

```
MATCH (output:Movie)
RETURN output.title
```

instead of getting nodes, just want to have all the movie titles

![Match Query 1](/img/match9.png)

```
MATCH (output:Movie)
MATCH (director:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(output)
RETURN output.title
```

or

```
MATCH (output:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(director:Person)
RETURN output.title
```

in the above query, we are printing the `movie title` for which the relationship is been declared as `DIRECTED` between Movie and Person node.

![Match Query 1](/img/match10.png)

```
MATCH (output:Movie)
MATCH (director:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(output)
MATCH (director)-[:ACTED_IN]->(output)
RETURN output.title
```

filtering relation with multiple conditions.
Condition 1 : To take the values which are related to `Person` and `Movie` with the relation `DIRECTED` 
Condition 2 : From the above output which data is related to `Person` and `Movie` with the relation `ACTED_IN`

![Match Query 1](/img/match11.png)

```
MATCH (output:Movie)
MATCH (director:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(output)
MATCH (director)-[:ACTED_IN]->(output)
RETURN output.title, director.name
```

to get the movie title as well as the director name.

![Match Query 1](/img/match12.png)

```
MATCH (output:Movie)
OPTIONAL MATCH (director:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(output)<-[:ACTED_IN]->(director)
RETURN output.title, director.name
```

*OPTIONAL MATCH* - optional match doesn't make the condition compulsory
