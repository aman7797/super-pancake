## Rich People Reverted

Actually, I changed my mind. Let's undo the work that we just did..

Remove the Rich label, and total_earnings properties

```
MATCH (person:Person)-[rel:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)
WITH person, SUM(rel.earnings) as TotalEarning
WHERE TotalEarning>50000000
REMOVE person:RICH, person.total_earnings
RETURN person
```
