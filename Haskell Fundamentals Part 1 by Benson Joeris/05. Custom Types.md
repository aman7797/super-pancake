# Custom Types

## Type Synonyms

    type String = [Char]

    type Point = (Double, Double)

- Make code more readable
- Semantic Meaning
- Completely ignored by compiler

## Newtype

    newtype CustomerId = MakeCustomerId Int

- Create a new type represent by an existing type
- New Type and representation cannot bw mixed up
- Add semantic meaning, checked by compiler

## Records

```haskell
data Customer = MakeCustomer
{
    customerId :: CustomerId
,   name :: String
,   lucky :: Int
}
```

- Not extensible
- No shared field names

## Algebric Data Types

```haskell
data Customer = MakeCustomer CustomerId String Int
```

- Package some value together
- Named container

## Algebraic Data Type Construction

```haskell
data Bool = False | True
```

- Types like this call enum in other language

```haskell
data MaybeInt = NotInt | JustInt Int
```

- Constructors -different kinds of values for a type

## Parameterized Types

```haskell
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

```haskell
x :: Maybe Int
x = Nothing
```

- Parametrized type can hold any type like generic type
