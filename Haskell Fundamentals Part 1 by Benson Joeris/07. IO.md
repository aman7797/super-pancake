# IO

## Hello World

```haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello World"
```

- Haskell functions are pure
    - cannot modify any external state
    - value cannnot depend on external state
    - cannot write to the console

## IO Actions

IO unit is a IO action can talk with external source
- main - IO action executed by the program

## Do Blocks

```haskell
main :: IO
main = do
    putStrln "Hello "
    putStrln "World"
```

## IO Values
```haskell
main :: IO()
main = do
    line <- getLine
    putStrLn ("You said :: " ++ line)
```

## Return Function

```haskell
dummyGetLine :: IO String
dummyGetLine =
    return "I'm not doing"
```

## Some  Useful IO Actions

Print a string to the console, and append a new line

    putStrLn :: String -> IO ()

Reads a line from the console

    getLine :: IO String

Print string representation of a value

    print :: (Show a) => a -> IO()

Read an entire file as a (lazy) string

    readFile :: FilePath -> IO String

Write a string to a file

    writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO()

Appends a string to a file

    appendFile:: FilePath -> String -> IO()


## Program Organization

- Do as little in IO as possible
