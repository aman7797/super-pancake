# Building Projects

## Intermission: Check your understanding
Here is the import list from one of the modules in Chris’s library
called blacktip:
```haskell
import qualified Control.Concurrent
as CC
import qualified Control.Concurrent.MVar
as MV
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8
as B
import qualified Data.Locator
as DL
import qualified Data.Time.Clock.POSIX
as PSX
import qualified Filesystem
as FS
import qualified Filesystem.Path.CurrentOS
as FPC
import qualified Network.Info
as NI
import qualified Safe
import Control.Exception (mask, try)
import Control.Monad (forever, when)
import Data.Bits
import Data.Bits.Bitwise (fromListBE)
import Data.List.Split (chunksOf)
import Database.Blacktip.Types
import System.IO.Unsafe (unsafePerformIO)
```
For our purposes right now, it does not matter whether you are
familiar with the modules referenced in the import list. Look at the
declarations and answer the questions below:
1. What functions are being imported from Control.Monad?
   
    import Control.Monad (forever, when)
    forever and when  

2. Which imports are both unqualified and imported in their entirety?
   
   import Data.Bits
    import Database.Blacktip.Types

3. From the name, what do you suppose importing Blacktip’s
Types module brings in?

    import Database.Blacktip.Types
    Types of Blacktip

4. Now let’s compare a small part of blacktip’s code to the above
import list:

    ```haskell
    writeTimestamp :: MV.MVar ServerState -> FPC.FilePath -> IO CC.ThreadId
    writeTimestamp s path = do
        CC.forkIO go
            where go = forever $ do
                ss <- MV.readMVar s
                mask $ \_ -> do
                FS.writeFile path (B.pack (show (ssTime ss)))
                -- sleep for 1 second
                CC.threadDelay 1000000
    ```
    a) The type signature refers to three aliased imports. What modules are named in those aliases?

    Control.Concurrent.MVar, Filesystem.Path.CurrentOS and Control.Concurrent

    b) Which import does FS.writeFile refer to?

    import qualified Filesystem as FS

    c) Which import did forever come from?

    import Control.Monad (forever, when)

## Chapter exercises

**Hangman game logic**

You may have noticed when you were playing with the hangman
game, that there are some weird things about its game logic:

- although it can play with words up to 9 characters long, you only get to guess 7 characters;
- it ends the game after 7 guesses, whether they were correct or incorrect;
- if your 7th guess supplies the last letter in the word, it may still tell you you lost;
- it picks some very strange words that you didn’t suspect were even in the dictionary.

These make it unlike hangman as you might have played it in the
past. Ordinarily, only incorrect guesses count against you, so you
can make as many correct guesses as you need to fill in the word.
Modifying the game so that it either gives you more guesses before
the game ends or only uses shorter words (or both) involves only a
couple of uncomplicated steps.
A bit more complicated but worth attempting as an exercise is
changing the game so that, as with normal hangman, only incorrect
guesses count towards the guess limit.

**Modifying code**

1. Ciphers: Open your Ciphers module and modify it so that the
Caesar and Vigenère ciphers work with user input.

2. Here is a very simple, short block of code. Notice it has a forever
that will make it keep running, over and over again. Load it into
your REPL and test it out. Then refer back to the chapter and
modify it to exit successfully after a False result.
    ```haskell
    import Control.Monad
    palindrome :: IO ()
    palindrome = forever $ do
    line1 <- getLine
    case (line1 == reverse line1) of
    True -> putStrLn "It's a palindrome!"
    False -> putStrLn "Nope!"
    ```

    ```haskell
    import Control.Monad
    import System.Exit (exitSuccess)
    import Data.Char (toLower, isLetter)

    palindrome :: IO ()
    palindrome = forever $ do
        line1 <- getLine >>= (return . filter isLetter .  map toLower)
        case (line1 == reverse line1) of
            True -> putStrLn "It's a palindrome!"
            False -> do
                putStrLn "Nope!"
                exitSuccess
    ```

3. If you tried using palindrome on a sentence such as “Madam
I’m Adam,” you may have noticed that palindrome checker
doesn’t work on that. Modifying the above so that it works on
sentences, too, involves several steps. You may need to refer
back to previous examples in the chapter to get ideas for proper
ordering and nesting. You may wish to import Data.Char to use
the function toLower. Have fun.

    ```haskell
    import Control.Monad
    import System.Exit (exitSuccess)
    import Data.Char (toLower, isLetter)

    palindrome :: IO ()
    palindrome = forever $ do
        line1 <- getLine 
        let smallLine1 = filter isLetter $ map toLower line1
        case (smallLine1 == reverse smallLine1) of
            True -> putStrLn "It's a palindrome!"
            False -> do
                putStrLn "Nope!"
                exitSuccess
    ```

4.  
   ```haskell
    type Name = String
    type Age = Integer
    data Person = Person Name Age deriving Show
    data PersonInvalid = NameEmpty
    | AgeTooLow
    | PersonInvalidUnknown String
    deriving (Eq, Show)
    mkPerson :: Name
    -> Age
    -> Either PersonInvalid Person
    mkPerson name age
    | name /= "" && age > 0 = Right $ Person name age
    | name == "" = Left NameEmpty
    | not (age > 0) = Left AgeTooLow
    | otherwise = Left $ PersonInvalidUnknown $
    "Name was: " ++ show name ++
    " Age was: " ++ show age
    ```

    ```haskell
    gimmePerson :: IO ()
    gimmePerson = do
        putStr $ "Enter name: "
        name <- getLine
        putStr $ "Enter age: "
        age <- getLine
        if (any (not . isDigit) age)
        then do
            putStrLn "Age is not number"
            exitFailure
        else
            return ()
        let p = mkPerson name $ read age
        putStrLn "Person is:"
        putStrLn $ show p
  ```
