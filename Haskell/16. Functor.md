# Functor

- When a value is wrapped in context, we can't apply normal functon to it.
- Functor is a type class
- Functor is any data type that defines how "fmap" applies to it
- Use fmap on a function, just doing function composition
  
## fmap 
- knows how to apply function to value that are wrapped in a context.
- <$> is a infix cersion of fmap
- Example :: 
  ```haskell
  fmap (+3) (Just 2)
  > Just 5
  ```
## The functor laws
When providing a new instance of Functor, you should ensure it satisfies the two functor laws. There is nothing mysterious about these laws; their role is to guarantee fmap behaves sanely and actually performs a mapping operation (as opposed to some other nonsense). 

The first law is:

```haskell
fmap id = id
```
id is the identity function, which returns its argument unaltered. The first law states that mapping id over a functorial value must return the functorial value unchanged.

Next, the second law:
```haskell
fmap (g . f) = fmap g . fmap f
```
It states that it should not matter whether we map a composed function or first map one function and then the other (assuming the application order remains the same in both cases)
## Exercises: Be Kind
Given a type signature, determine the kinds of each type variable:
1. What’s the kind of 𝑎?

    a -> a

    ```haskell
    *
    ```

2. What are the kinds of 𝑏 and 𝑇 ? (The 𝑇 is capitalized on purpose!)
    
    a -> b a -> T (b a)

    ```haskell
    b
    * -> *
    T
    * -> *
    ```
3. What’s the kind of 𝑐?
    
    c a b -> c b a

    ```haskell
    * -> * -> *
    ```

## Exercises: Heavy Lifting
Add fmap, parentheses, and function composition to the expression
as needed for the expression to typecheck and produce the expected
result. It may not always need to go in the same place, so don’t get
complacent.
1. ```haskell
   a = (+1) $ read "[1]" :: [Int]
   ```
     
    Expected result
    ```haskell
    Prelude> a
    [2]
    ```

    ```haskell
   a = fmap (+1) $ read "[1]" :: [Int]
   ```
2. ```haskell
   b = (++ "lol") (Just ["Hi,", "Hello"])
   ```
    ```haskell
    Prelude> b
    Just ["Hi,lol","Hellolol"]
    ```
    ```haskell
    b = (fmap . fmap) (++ "lol") (Just ["Hi,", "Hello"])
    ```
3. ```haskell
   c = (*2) (\x -> x - 2)
   ```
    ```haskell
    Prelude> c 1
    -2
    ```
    ```haskell
   c = fmap (*2) (\x -> x - 2)
   ```

4. ```haskell
   d = ((return '1' ++) . show) (\x -> [x, 1..3])
   ```
    ```haskell
    Prelude> d 0
    "1[0,1,2,3]"
    ```
     ```haskell
   d = fmap ((return '1' ++) . show) (\x -> [x, 1..3])
   ```
5. ```haskell
    e :: IO Integer
    e = let ioi = readIO "1" :: IO Integer
            changed = read ("123"++) show ioi
        in (*3) changed
    ```
    ```haskell
    Prelude> e
    3693
    ```
    ```haskell
    e :: IO Integer
    e = let ioi = readIO "1" :: IO Integer
            changed = read ("123"++) show ioi
        in fmap (*3) changed
    ```
## Exercises: Instances of Func
Implement Functor instances for the following datatypes. Use the
QuickCheck properties we just showed you to validate them.
1. ```haskell
   newtype Identity a = Identity a
   ```
2. ```haskell
   data Pair a = Pair a a
   ```
3. ```haskell
   data Two a b = Two a b
   ```
4. ```haskell
   data Three a b c = Three a b c
   ```
5. ```haskell
   data Three' a b = Three' a b b
   ```
6. ```haskell
   data Four a b c d = Four a b c d
   ```
7. ```haskell
   data Four' a b = Four' a a a b
   ```
8. Can you implement one for this type? Why? Why not?
    ```haskell
    data Trivial = Trivial
    ```
    Doing these exercises is critical to understanding how Functors
work, do not skip past them!

`Go through 16.Functor.hs for the above exercise`

## Exercise: Possibly
Write a Functor instance for a datatype identical to Maybe. We’ll use
our own datatype because Maybe already has a Functor instance and
we cannot make a duplicate one.
```haskell
data Possibly a = LolNope | Yeppers a deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Functor Possibly where
    fmap = undefined
```

If it helps, you’re basically writing the following function:
```haskell
applyIfJust :: (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
```

```haskell
data Possibly a = LolNope | Yeppers a deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Functor Possibly where
    fmap f (Yeppers a) = Yeppers (f a)
    fmap _ LolNope = LolNope

instance (Arbitrary a) => Arbitrary(Possibly a) where
    arbitrary = do
        a <- arbitrary
        (oneof . (fmap return)) [LolNope, Yeppers a]

type PossiblyFC = Possibly Int -> IntToInt -> IntToInt -> Bool
```

## Short Exercise
1. Write a Functor instance for a datatype identical to Either. We’ll
use our own datatype because Either also already has a Functor
instance.
    ```haskell
    data Sum a b = First a | Second b deriving (Eq, Show)
    instance Functor (Sum a) where
        fmap = undefined
    ```
    Your hint for this one is that you’re writing the following function.
    ```haskell
    applyIfSecond :: (a -> b) -> (Sum e) a -> (Sum e) b
    ```

    ```haskell
    data Sum a b = First a | Second b deriving (Eq, Show)
    
    instance Functor (Sum a) where
        fmap _ (First a) = First a 
        fmap f (Second b) = Second (f b)
    
    instance (Arbitrary a, Arbitrary b) => Arbitrary(Sum a b) where
    arbitrary = do
        a <- arbitrary
        b <- arbitrary
        (oneof . (fmap return)) [First a, Second b]

    type SumFC = Sum String Int -> IntToInt -> IntToInt -> Bool 
    ```

2. Why is a Functor instance that applies the function only to First, Either’s Left, impossible? We covered this earlier.
   
   `As the Functor instance kind * -> * which means the rightmost types`

## Chapter exercises
Determine if a valid Functor can be written for the datatype provided.
1. ```haskell
   data Bool = False | True
   ```
   `No, as Bool is of kind *`

2. ```haskell
   data BoolAndSomethingElse a = False' a | True' a
   ```

   `Yes, BoolAndSomethingElse of kind * -> *`

3. ```haskell
   data BoolAndMaybeSomethingElse a = Falsish | Truish a
   ```
   ```haskell
   data BoolAndMaybeSomethingElse a = Falsish | Truish a

    instance Functor BoolAndMaybeSomethingElse where
        fmap _ Falsish = Falsish
        fmap f (Truish a) = Truish (f a)
    ```
4. Use the kinds to guide you on this one, don’t get too hung up on the details.
    ```haskell
    newtype Mu f = InF { outF :: f (Mu f) }
    ```
    `No, Mu is of kind (* -> *) -> *`

5. Again, just follow the kinds and ignore the unfamiliar parts
    ```haskell
    import GHC.Arr
    data D = D (Array Word Word) Int Int
    ```
    `No, D is not of king * -> *`

Rearrange the arguments to the type constructor of the datatype so the Functor instance works.
1. ```haskell
   data Sum a b = First a | Second b

    instance Functor (Sum e) where
        fmap f (First a) = First (f a)
        fmap f (Second b) = Second b
    ```
    ```haskell
   data Sum a b = First a | Second b
   
    instance Functor (Sum e) where
        fmap f (First a) = First (f a)
        fmap _ (Second b) = Second b
    ```
2. ```haskell
   data Company a b c = DeepBlue a c | Something b
    instance Functor (Company e e') where
        fmap f (Something b) = Something (f b)
        fmap _ (DeepBlue a c) = DeepBlue a c
    ```

    ```haskell
    data Company a c b = DeepBlue a c | Something b

    instance Functor (Company e e') where
        fmap f (Something b) = Something (f b)
        fmap _ (DeepBlue a c) = DeepBlue a c
    ```
3. ```haskell
   data More a b =
    L a b a
    | R b a b
    deriving (Eq, Show)
    instance Functor (More x) where
    fmap f (L a b a') = L (f a) b (f a')
    fmap f (R b a b') = R b (f a) b'
    ```
    Keeping in mind that it should result in a Functor that does the
following:
    ```haskell
    Prelude> fmap (+1) (L 1 2 3)
    L 2 2 4
    Prelude> fmap (+1) (R 1 2 3)
    R 1 3 3
    ```

    ```haskell
    data More b a = L a b a | R b a b deriving (Eq, Show)

    instance Functor (More x) where
        fmap f (L a b a') = L (f a) b (f a')
        fmap f (R b a b') = R b (f a) b'
    ```
Write Functor instances for the following datatypes.
1. ```haskell
   data Quant a b =
    Finance
    | Desk a
    | Bloor b
    ```

2. No, it’s not interesting by itself.
    ```haskell
    data K a b = K a
    ```

3. ```haskell
   {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}
    newtype Flip f a b = Flip (f b a) deriving (Eq, Show)
    newtype K a b = K a
    -- should remind you of an
    -- instance you've written before
    instance Functor (Flip K a) where
        fmap = undefined
    ```


4. ```haskell
    data EvilGoateeConst a b = GoatyConst b
    -- You thought you'd escaped the goats
    -- by now didn't you? Nope.
    ```
    No, it doesn’t do anything interesting. No magic here or in the
previous exercise. If it works, you succeeded.
5. Do you need something extra to make the instance work?
    ```haskell
    data LiftItOut f a = LiftItOut (f a)
    ```
6. ```haskell
   data Parappa f g a = DaWrappa (f a) (g a)
   ```
7. Don’t ask for more typeclass instances than you need. You can
let GHC tell you what to do.
    ```haskell
    data IgnoreOne f g a b =
    IgnoringSomething (f a) (g b)
    ```
8. ```haskell
    data Notorious g o a t =
        Notorious (g o) (g a) (g t)
    ```
9.  You’ll need to use recursion.
    ```haskell
    data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
    ```
10. A tree of goats forms a Goat-Lord, fearsome poly-creature.
    ```haskell
    data GoatLord a =
    NoGoat
    | OneGoat a
    | MoreGoats (GoatLord a) (GoatLord a) (GoatLord a)
    -- A VERITABLE HYDRA OF GOATS
    ```
11. You’ll use an extra functor for this one, although your solution
might do it monomorphically without using fmap.3 Keep in
mind that you will probably not be able to validate this one in
the usual manner. Do your best to make it work.
    ```haskell
    data TalkToMe a =
    Halt
    | Print String a
    | Read (String -> a)
    ```
