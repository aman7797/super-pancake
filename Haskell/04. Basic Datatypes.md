# Basic Datatypes

```Haskell
data Bool = False | True
```

- `Bool` - type constructor for datatype Bool. This is the name of the type and shows up in type signatures.
- `False` - Data constructor for the value False
- `|` - Pipe | indicates a sum type or logical disjunction: "or". So, a Bool value is `True` or `False`
- `True` - Data constructor for the value True

## Exercises: Mood Swing
Given the following datatype, answer the following questions:
    
    data Mood = Blah | Woot deriving Show
The deriving Show part is not something we’ve explained yet. For now, all we’ll say is that when you make your own datatypes, deriving Show allows the values of that type to be printed to the screen. We’ll talk about it more when we talk about typeclasses in detail.
1. What is the type constructor, or name of this type?

    Mood

2. If the function requires a Mood value, what are the values you could possibly use there?

    Value not required, can use Blah and Woot

3. We are trying to write a function changeMood to change Chris’s mood instantaneously. It should act like not in that, given one value, it returns the other value of the same type. So far, we’ve
written a type signature changeMood :: Mood -> Woot. What’s wrong with that?

    Return type should be Mood

4. Now we want to write the function that changes his mood. Given an input mood, it gives us the other one. Fix any mistakes and complete the function:

        changeMood Mood = Woot
        changeMood _ = Blah
    We’re doing something here called pattern matching. We can define a function by matching on a data constructor, or value, and descrbing the behavior the function should have based on which value it matches. The underscore in the second line denotes a catch-all, otherwise case. So, in the first line of the function, we’re telling it what to do in the case of a specific input. In the second one, we’re telling it what to do regardless of all potential inputs. It’s trivial when there are only two potential values of a given type, but as we deal with more complex cases, it
    can be convenient. We’ll talk about pattern matching in greater detail in a later chapter.

    ```haskell
    changeMood :: Mood -> Mood
    changeMood Blah = Woot
    changeMood Woot = Blah
    ```
5. Enter all of the above — datatype (including the deriving Show bit), your corrected type signature, and the corrected function into a source file. Load it and run it in GHCi to make sure you got it right.

**Integral** numbers These are whole numbers, positive and negative
1. `Int`: This type is a fixed-precision integer. By “fixed precision,”
we mean it has a range, with a maximum and a minimum, and
so it cannot be arbitrarily large or small — more about this in a
moment.
2. `Integer`: This type is also for integers, but this one supports
arbitrarily large (or small) numbers.

**Fractional** These are not integers. Fractional values include the
following four types:
1. `Float`: This is the type used for single-precision floating point
numbers. Fixed-point number representations have immutable
numbers of digits assigned for the parts of the number before
and after the decimal point. In contrast, floating point can shift
how many bits it uses to represent numbers before or after
the decimal point. This flexibility does, however, mean that
floating point arithmetic violates some common assumptions
and should only be used with great care. Generally, floating
point numbers should not be used at all in business applications.
2. `Double`: This is a double-precision floating point number type.
It has twice as many bits with which to describe numbers as the
Float type.
3. `Rational`: This is a fractional number that represents a ratio of
two integers. The value 1 / 2 :: Rational will be a value carrying two Integer values, the numerator 1 and the denominator
2, and represents a ratio of 1 to 2. Rational is arbitrarily precise
but not as efficient as Scientific.
4. `Scientific`: This is a space efficient and almost-arbitrary precision scientific number type. Scientific numbers are represented
using scientific notation. It stores the coefficient as an Integer
and the exponent as an Int. Since Int isn’t arbitrarily-large there
is technically a limit to the size of number you can express with
Scientific, but hitting that limit is quite unlikely. Scientific is
available in a library

## Exercises: Find the Mistakes
The following lines of code may have mistakes — some of them
won’t compile! You know what you need to do.
1. not True && true

    true is not of type Bool
2. not (x = 6)

    x is not comparing value
3. (1 * 2) > 5

    False
4. [Merry] > [Happy]

    [Char] should be in " "
    "Merry" > "Happy"
5. [1, 2, 3] ++ "look at me!"

    list of int can't append with list of char

## Chapter Exercises
As in previous chapters, you will gain more by working out the answer
before you check what GHCi tells you, but be sure to use your REPL
to check your answers to the following exercises. Also, you will need
to have the awesome, alsoAwesome, and allAwesome code from above in
scope for this REPL session. For convenience of reference, here are
those values again:
```haskell
awesome = ["Papuchon", "curry", ":)"]
alsoAwesome = ["Quake", "The Simons"]
allAwesome = [awesome, alsoAwesome]
```

length is a function that takes a list and returns a result that tells
how many items are in the list.
1. Given the definition of length above, what would the type signature be? How many arguments, of what type does it take? What is the type of the result it evaluates to?

    ```haskell
    length :: [a] -> Int
    length a =output
    ```

2. What are the results of the following expressions?
   
    a) length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        5
    b) length [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]

        3
    c) length allAwesome

        2
    d) length (concat allAwesome)

        5
3. Given what we know about numeric types and the type signature
of length, look at these two expressions. One works and one
returns an error. Determine which will return an error and why.
(n.b., you will find Foldable t => t a representing [a], as with
concat in the previous chapter. Again, consider Foldable t to
represent a list here, even though list is only one of the possible
types.)

    Prelude> 6 / 3

    -- and

    Prelude> 6 / length [1, 2, 3]

4. How can you fix the broken code from the preceding exercise
using a different division function/operator?

5. What is the type of the expression 2 + 3 == 5? What would we
expect as a result?

    Num

    True
6. What is the type and expected result value of the following:
    ```haskell
    Prelude> let x = 5
    Prelude> x + 3 == 5
    ```
    Num 

    Boolean

7. Below are some bits of code. Which will work? Why or why
not? If they will work, what value would these reduce to?
    
    `Prelude> length allAwesome == 2`

    true

   `Prelude> length [1, 'a', 3, 'b']`

    Error list have different data type

    `Prelude> length allAwesome + length awesome`

    5

    `Prelude> (8 == 8) && ('b' < 'a')`

    False

    `Prelude> (8 == 8) && 9`

    Error boolean operation with num type can not be done

8. Write a function that tells you whether or not a given String (or
list) is a palindrome. Here you’ll want to use a function called
’reverse,’ a predefined function that does just what it sounds like.
    ```haskell
    reverse :: [a] -> [a]
    reverse "blah"
    "halb"
    isPalindrome :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Bool
    isPalindrome x = undefined
    ```
    ```haskell
    isPalindrome :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Bool
    isPalindrome x = x == reverse(x)
    ```

9. Write a function to return the absolute value of a number using
if-then-else
myAbs :: Integer -> Integer
myAbs = undefined


10. Fill in the definition of the following function, using fst and
snd:

    f :: (a, b) -> (c, d) -> ((b, d), (a, c))
    f = undefined


    ```haskell
    f :: (a, b) -> (c, d) -> ((b, d), (a, c))
    f a b = ((snd(a),snd(b)),(fst(a),fst(b)))
    ```

**Correcting syntax**
In the following examples, you’ll be shown syntactically incorrect
code. Type it in and try to correct it in your text editor, validating it
with GHC or GHCi.
1. Here, we want a function that adds 1 to the length of a string
argument and returns that result.
        x = (+)
        F xs = w 'x' 1
    where w = length xs

    - `x` is the char not the function

2. This is supposed to be the identity function, id.
        \ X = x

3. When fixed, this function will return 1 from the value [1, 2, 3].
Hint: you may need to refer back to the section about variables
conventions in “Hello Haskell” to refresh your memory of this
notation.
        \ x : xs -> x


4. When fixed, this function will return 1 from the value (1, 2).
f (a b) = A
**Match the function names to their types**
1. Which of the following types is the type of show?
a) show a => a -> String
b) Show a -> a -> String
`c) Show a => a -> String`
2. Which of the following types is the type of (==)?
a) a -> a -> Bool
`b) Eq a => a -> a -> Bool`
c) Eq a -> a -> a -> Bool
d) Eq a => A -> Bool
3. Which of the following types is the type of fst?
`a) (a, b) -> a`
b) b -> a
c) (a, b) -> b
4. Which of the following types is the type of (+)?
a) (+) :: Num a -> a -> a -> Bool
b) (+) :: Num a => a -> a -> Bool
c) (+) :: num a => a -> a -> a
`d) (+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a`
e) (+) :: a -> a -> a
