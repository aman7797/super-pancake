# Applicative

The more core operation of this typeclass is <*>. This is an infix function
called ‘apply’ or sometimes ‘ap,’ or sometimes ‘tie-fighter’ when we’re
feeling particularly zippy.

## Exercises: Lookups
In the following exercises you will need to use the following terms
to make the expressions type-check:
1. ```
   pure
   ```
2. ```haskell
   (<$>)
    -- or fmap
    ```
3. ```haskell
   (<*>)
   ```
Make the following expressions type-check.
1. ```haskell
   added :: Maybe Integer
   added = (+3) (lookup 3 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6])
   ```
    ```haskell
    added :: Maybe Integer
    added = (+3) <$> (lookup 3 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6])
    ```
2. ```haskell
   y :: Maybe Integer
    y = lookup 3 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]
    z :: Maybe Integer
    z = lookup 2 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]
    tupled :: Maybe (Integer, Integer)
    tupled = (,) y z
    ```
    ```haskell
    y :: Maybe Integer
    y = lookup 3 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

    z :: Maybe Integer
    z = lookup 2 $ zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

    tupled :: Maybe (Integer, Integer)
    tupled = (,) <$> y <*> z
    ```
3. ```haskell
   import Data.List (elemIndex)
    x :: Maybe Int
    x = elemIndex 3 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    y :: Maybe Int
    y = elemIndex 4 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    max' :: Int -> Int -> Int
    max' = max
    maxed :: Maybe Int
    maxed = max' x y
    ```
    ```haskell
    x :: Maybe Int
    x = elemIndex 3 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    y :: Maybe Int
    y = elemIndex 4 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    max' :: Int -> Int -> Int
    max' = max

    maxed :: Maybe Int
    maxed = max' <$>  x <*> y
    ```
4. ```haskell
    xs = [1, 2, 3]
    ys = [4, 5, 6]
    x :: Maybe Integer
    x = lookup 3 $ zip xs ys
    y :: Maybe Integer
    y = lookup 2 $ zip xs ys
    summed :: Maybe Integer
    summed = sum $ (,) x y
    ```
    ```haskell
    xs = [1, 2, 3]

    ys = [4, 5, 6]

    x :: Maybe Integer
    x = lookup 3 $ zip xs ys

    y :: Maybe Integer
    y = lookup 2 $ zip xs ys

    summed :: Maybe Integer
    summed = sum <$> ((,) <$> x <*> y)
    ```
## Exercise: Identity Instance
Write an Applicative instance for Identity.
```haskell
newtype Identity a = Identity a deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

instance Functor Identity where
    fmap = undefined

instance Applicative Identity where
    pure = undefined
    (<*>) = undefined
```
```haskell
newtype Identity a = Identity a deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

instance Functor Identity where
    fmap f (Identity a)= Identity (f a)

instance Applicative Identity where
    pure = Identity
    Identity f <*> Identity a = Identity (f a)
```

## Exercise: Constant Instance
Write an Applicative instance for Constant.
```haskell
newtype Constant a b = Constant { getConstant :: a } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

instance Functor (Constant a) where
    fmap = undefined   

instance Monoid a => Applicative (Constant a) where
    pure a = undefined
    (<*>) = undefined
```
```haskell
newtype Constant a b = Constant { getConstant :: a } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

instance Functor (Constant a) where
    fmap _ (Constant a) = Constant a

instance Monoid a => Applicative (Constant a) where
  pure a = Constant mempty
  (<*>) :: Constant a (x -> y) -> Constant a x -> Constant a y
  (Constant x) <*> (Constant y) = Constant $ x `mappend` y
```

## Exercise: Fixer Upper
Given the function and values provided, use (<$>) from Functor,
(<*>) and pure from the Applicative typeclass to fill in missing bits of
the broken code to make it work.
1. ```haskell
   const <$> Just "Hello" <*> "World"
   ```
   ```haskell
   const <$> Just "Hello" <*> pure "World"
   ```
2. ```haskell
   (,,,) Just 90 <*> Just 10 Just "Tierness" [1, 2, 3]
   ```
   ```haskell
   (,,,) <$> Just 90 <*> Just 10 <*> Just "Tierness" <*> pure [1, 2, 3]
   ```

## List Applicative Exercise
Implement the List Applicative. Writing a minimally complete Applicative
instance calls for writing the definitions of both pure and
<*>. We’re going to provide a hint as well. Use the checkers library to
validate your Applicative instance.
```haskell
data List a =
Nil
| Cons a (List a)
deriving (Eq, Show)
```
Remember what you wrote for the List Functor:
```haskell
instance Functor List where
    fmap = undefined
```
Writing the List Applicative is similar.

```haskell
instance Applicative List where
    pure = undefined
    (<*>) = undefined
```
Expected result:
```haskell
Prelude> let functions = Cons (+1) (Cons (*2) Nil)
Prelude> let values = Cons 1 (Cons 2 Nil)
Prelude> functions <*> values
Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Cons 2 (Cons 4 Nil)))
```
