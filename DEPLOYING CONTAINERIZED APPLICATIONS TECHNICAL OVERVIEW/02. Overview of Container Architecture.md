# Overview of Container Architecture

##  How do Containers Work?

`Namespaces` The kernel can place specific system  resources that are normally visible to all processes into a namespace. This **isolated resources.**

`Control Group` partition seds of processes and their childrer into groups to manage and **limit the resources** they consume.

`Seccomp` Introduced to containers around 2014, Seccomp limits **how** processes could use system calls.

`SELinux` The Linux kernel uses SELinux to protext processes from each other and to protect the host system from its running processes.

**Containers** are segragated user-space environment for running application isolated from other applications sharing the same OS.

**Image** Templates for containers that include a runtime environment and all of the libraries and configuration files.

**Image Repository** Registries store images for public or private use.
1. Red Hat Container Catalog
2. REd Hat Quay
3. Docker hub

**Podman** 
- Podman is an open source tool for managing containers and container images and interacting with image registries.
- Podman uses image format specified by the Open Container Initiative(OCI). Those specifications define an standard, community-driven, non-proprietary image format.
- Podman store local images in local file-system. Doing so avoids unnecessary client/server architecture or having daemons running on local machine.
- Podman follows the same command patterns as the Docker CLI.
- Podman is compatible with Kubernetes
- To install podman in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora or similar RPM-based systems, run 

        sudo yum install podman

    or

        sudo dnf install podman

**Podman Commands**

Print out information about containers:
    
    podman ps

List all containers (both running and stopped):

    podman ps --all

Start one or more containers:
    
    podman start container_name container_id

Stop one or more running containers:
    
    podman stop container_name container_id

Pull an image from a registry (defaults to the Docker Hub):
    
    podman pull image_name:image_tag

Open a shell inside of an already running container:
    
    podman exec --interactive --tty container_name sh

Remove one or more stopped containers:
    
    podman rm container_name container_id

Display the logs of one or more containers and follow log output:
    
    podman logs --follow container_name container_id
