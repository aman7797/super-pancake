# Fibonacci Numbers

## Objective
In this challenge, we learn about using the Fibonacci Function.

## Resources
Here's a helpful video on the topic: [The magic of Fibonacci numbers](https://youtu.be/SjSHVDfXHQ4)


The Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci sequence begins with `0` and `1`. These are the first and second terms, respectively. After this, every element is the sum of the preceding elements:

    Fibonacci(n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)  
## Task
Given the starter code, complete the Fibonacci function to return the `Nth` term.

We start counting from Fibonacci`(1) = 0`. This might differ from some other notations that treats Fibonacci `(0) = 0`.

The overall equation is:

                = 0 , n = 1
    Fibonacci(n) = 1 , n = 2
                Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)  , n > 2
## Input Format

One line of input, the integer `N`.

## Constraints

0 < ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N\leq40)
## Output Format

Output one integer, the  Fibonacci number.

## Sample Input

    3  
## Sample Output

    1  
## Function Prototype
The starter code is provided for Scala. The code for accepting the input and displaying the output is provided. You will be provided the input parameter `N`, and you need to return the `Nth` Fibonacci term.

## Sample Input and Output Values for the Fibonacci Series

    fibonacci(3) = (0+1) = 1  
    fibonacci(4) = (1+1) = 2  
    fibonacci(5) = (1+2) = 3  
## Requirements
Simple test cases can be cleared with a purely recursive function exponentially. To clear the more challenging test cases without violating the principles of functional programming, you might benefit from learning about the accumulator technique.

## Code

```haskell
--Contributed by Ron Watkins
module Main where


fib n = (fibonacci (n-1)) 

fibonacci :: Integral a => a -> a
fibonacci 0 = 0
fibonacci 1 = 1
fibonacci x = fibonacci (x - 1) + fibonacci (x - 2)

-- This part is related to the Input/Output and can be used as it is
-- Do not modify it
main = do
    input <- getLine
    print . fib . (read :: String -> Int) $ input
```
