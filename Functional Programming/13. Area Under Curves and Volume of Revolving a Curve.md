# Area Under Curves and Volume of Revolving a Curve

Definite Integrals via Numerical Methods

This relates to definite integration via numerical methods.

Consider the algebraic expression given by:

    (a1)x^b1 + (a2)x^b2 + (a3)x^b3 ...(an)x^bn

For the purpose of numerical computation, the area under the curve y=f(x) between the limits `a` and `b` can be computed by the Limit Definition of a Definite Integral.

Here is some background about **areas and volume computation**.

Using equal subintervals of length = `0.001`, you need to:

1. Evaluate the area bounded by a given polynomial function of the kind described above, between the given limits of  and .

2. Evaluate the volume of the solid obtained by revolving this polynomial curve around the -axis.

A relative error margin of `0.01` will be tolerated.

## Input Format

The first line contains `N` integers separated by spaces, which are the values of `a1, a2, a3,.....aN`.

The second line contains `N` integers separated by spaces, which are the values of `b1, b2, b3,.....bN`.

The third line contains two space separated integers, `L` and `R`, the lower and upper range limits in which the integration needs to be performed, respectively.

## Output Format

The first line should contain the area between the curve and the `x`-axis, bound between the specified limits.
The second line should contain the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the curve around the `x`-axis, between the specified limits.

## Sample Input

## Explanation

The algebraic expression represented by:

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(1)x^6) + ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(2)x^7) + ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(3)x^8) + ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(4)x^9) + ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(5)x^10)

We need to find the area of the curve enclosed under this curve, between the limits `x = 1` and `4`. We also need to find the volume of the solid formed by revolving this curve around the `x`-axis between the limits `x = 1` and `4`.

## Scoring

All test cases are weighted equally. You need to clear all the tests in a test case.
