# Evaluating e^x

The series expansion of ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^x) is given by:

1 + x + ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2/2!) + ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^3/3!) + ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^4/4!) ...

Evaluate ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^x) for given values of  by using the above expansion for the first `10` terms.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of test cases.
`N` lines follow. Each line contains a value of `x` for which you need to output the value of ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^x) using the above series expansion. These input values have exactly `4` decimal places each.

## Output Format

Output `N` lines, each containing the value of ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^x), computed by your program.

## Constraints

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1%20\leq%20N\leq%2050)

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=-20.0%20\leq%20x\leq%2020.0)

Var, Val in Scala and def and defn in Clojure are blocked keywords. The challenge is to accomplish this without either mutable state or direct declaration of local variables.

## Sample Input

    4
    20.0000
    5.0000
    0.5000
    -0.5000
## Sample Output

    2423600.1887
    143.6895
    1.6487
    0.6065
## Explanation

The output has the computed values of ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^x) corresponding to each test case. They are correct up to `4` decimal places and on separate lines.

## Scoring

All test cases carry an equal weight in the final score. For your solution to pass a given test case, all the values of ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^x) computed by you must be within `+/-0.1` of the expected answers. This tolerance level has been kept to account for slightly different answers across different languages.

## Code

```haskell
x n = sum $ take 10 $ solution n

solution :: Double -> [Double]
solution xValue = [xValue**numb/product[1..numb] | numb <- [0..]]

main :: IO ()
main = getContents >>= mapM_ print. map x. map (read::String->Double). tail. words
