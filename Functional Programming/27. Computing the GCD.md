# Computing the GCD

## Objective
In this challenge, we learn how to compute GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

## Resources
Here's a helpful video on the topic: [How to find Greatest Divisor by using Euclidian Algorithm](https://youtu.be/JUzYl1TYMcU)


Given two integers, `x` and `y`, a recursive technique to find their GCD is the Euclidean Algorithm.

The algorithm states that, for computing the GCD of two positive integers `x` and `y`, if `x` and `y` are equal, ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=GCD(x,%20y)%20=%20x). Otherwise ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=GCD(x,%20y)%20=%20GCD(x-y,%20y)) if `x > y`. There are a few optimizations that can be made to the above logic to arrive at a more efficient implementation.

**Task**
Given the starter code, you need to complete a function body that returns the GCD of two given integers `x` and `y`.
The task of reading in input and printing the output will be handled by us.

**Programming Language Support**
At this point of time, we have a template for Scala. This means that we provide the code required to accept the input and display the output.

## Input Format

One line of input containing `2` space separated integers.

## Constraints

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1%20\leq%20a,b\leq%2010^6)

## Output Format

Output one integer, the GCD of the two given numbers.

## Sample Input

    1 5 
## Sample Output

    1
## Explanation

## Sample Return Values:

    GCD(1,5) = 1  
    GCD(10,100) = 10  
    GCD(22,131) = 1


## Code

GCD - Greatest Common Divisor
    
    Integral a => a -> a -> a
Input: gcd 12 8

Output: 4
```haskell
module Main where


gcd' :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
gcd' n m
    | n == 0 = m
    | otherwise = gcd (m `mod` n) n


-- This part is related to the Input/Output and can be used as it is
-- Do not modify it
main = do
  input <- getLine
  print . uncurry gcd' . listToTuple . convertToInt . words $ input
 where
  listToTuple (x:xs:_) = (x,xs)
  convertToInt = map (read :: String -> Int)
```
