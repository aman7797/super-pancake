# Solve Me First FP

This is an introductory challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to give you a working I/O template in your preferred language. It includes scanning `2` integers from STDIN, calling a function, returning a value, and printing it to STDOUT.

Your task is to scan two numbers, `A` and `B` from STDIN, and print the sum `A+B` on STDOUT.

Note: The code has been saved in a template that you can submit if you want.

## Input Format

You are given two integers, `A` and `B` on separate lines.

## Output Format

Output an integer that denotes `A + B`

## Constraints

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1%20\leq%20A%20,%20B\leq%201000)

## Sample Input

    2
    3
## Sample Output

    5  

## Code
```haskell

solveMeFirst a b = a + b

main = do
    val1 <- readLn
    val2 <- readLn
    let sum = solveMeFirst val1 val2
    print sum
```
