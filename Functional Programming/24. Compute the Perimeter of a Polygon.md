# Compute the Perimeter of a Polygon

You are given the cartesian coordinates of a set of points in a `2D` plane. When traversed sequentially, these points form a Polygon,`P` , which is not self-intersecting in nature. Can you compute the perimeter of polygon `P`?

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer,`N` , denoting the number of points.
The `N` subsequent lines each contain `2` space-separated integers denoting the respective `x` and `y` coordinates of a point.

## Constraints

- No `2` points are coincident, and polygon `P` is obtained by traversing the points in a clockwise direction.
- ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=3%20\leq%20N\leq%201000)
- ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0%20\leq%20x,y\leq%201000)
  


## Output Format

For each test case, print the perimeter of `P` (correct to a scale of one decimal place).

**Note**: Do not add any leading/trailing spaces or units.

## Sample Input

    4
    0 0
    0 1  
    1 1  
    1 0
## Sample Output

    4
## Explanation

The given polygon is a square, and each of its sides are `1` unit in length. `perimeter(P) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`, so we print `4` on a new line.
