# Functions or Not?

## Objective
In this problem, we touch upon a basic concept that is fundamental to Functional Programming: identifying a relation which represents a valid function.

## Task
You are given a set of unique `(x,y)` ordered pairs constituting a relation. The `x`-values form the domain, and the `y`-values form the range to which they map. For each of these relations, identify whether they may possibly represent a valid function or not.

**Note**: You do not have to find the actual function, you just need to determine that the relation may be representative of some valid function.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer,`T` , denoting the number of test cases. The subsequent lines describe `T` test cases, and the input for each test case is as follows:

1. The first line contains an integer,`N` , the number of `(x,y)` pairs in the test case.
2. The `N` subsequent lines each contain two space-separated integers describing the respective `x` and `y` values for each ordered pair.

## Constraints

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1%20\leq%20T\leq%205)

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2%20\leq%20N\leq%20100)

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0%20\leq%20x,y\leq%20500)

## Output Format

On a new line for each test case, print `YES` if the set of ordered pairs represent a valid function, or `NO` if they do not.

## Sample Input

    2  
    3  
    1 1  
    2 2  
    3 3  
    4
    1 2
    2 4
    3 6  
    4 8  
## Sample Output

    YES  
    YES
## Explanation

Test Case 0:
`N = 3`, Ordered Pairs:  The set of ordered pairs represents a relation, which could represent a function such as 
![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f%20:%20N%20\rightarrow%20N,%20f(x)%20=%20x)
. Thus, we print `YES` on a new line.

Test Case 1:
, Ordered Pairs: 
The set of ordered pairs represents a relation, which could represent a function such as ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f%20:%20N%20\rightarrow%20N,%20f(x)%20=%202x). Thus, we print `YES` on a new line.

## Code

```haskell
import Control.Monad
import Data.List

testfst :: (Int,Int) -> (Int,Int) -> Bool
testfst (x1,y1) (x2,y2) = if x1 /= x2 then True else y1 == y2

testPairs a [] = a
testPairs a (x:[]) = a
testPairs a (x:y:res) = testPairs ((testfst x y):a) (y:res)

valid :: [(Int, Int)] -> Bool
valid f = and $ testPairs [] $ sort f

main = do
    t <- fmap (read::String->Int) getLine
    forM [1..t] (\_->do
        n <- fmap (read::String->Int) getLine
        func <- forM [1..n] (\_->do fmap ((\[a, b]->(a,b)).map (read::String->Int).words) getLine :: IO (Int, Int))
        putStrLn $ if valid func then "YES" else "NO")
