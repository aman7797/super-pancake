# Update List

Update the values of a list with their absolute values. The input and output portions will be handled automatically during grading. You only need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

## Input Format

There are `N` integers, each on a separate line. These are the `N` elements of the input array.

## Output Format

Output the absolute value of `N` integers, each on a separate line in the same input order.

## Sample Input

    2
    -4
    3
    -1
    23
    -4
    -54
## Sample Output

    2
    4
    3
    1
    23
    4
    54
## Constraints

The list will have no more than `100` integers.

Each integer,`X` , in the list: ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=-100%20\leq%20X\leq%20100).

## Recommended Method Signature

    Number Of Parameters: 1
    Parameters: [list]
    Returns: List or Vector
## For Hackers Using Clojure

This will be the outline of your function body (fill in the blank portion marked by underscores):

    (fn[lst]___________________________)
## For Hackers Using Scala

This will be the outline of your function body (fill in the blank portion marked by underscores):

    def f(arr:List[Int]):List[Int] = __________________
## For Hackers Using Haskell

This will be the outline of your function body (fill in the blank portion marked by underscores):

    f arr = ___________________
## For Hackers Using other Languages

You have to read input from standard input and write output to standard output. Please follow the input/output format mentioned above.

**NOTE**: You only need to submit the code above after filling in the blanks appropriately. The input and output section will be handled by us. The focus is on writing the correct function.

## Code

```haskell
-- Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

updateList :: [Int] -> [Int]
updateList [] = []
updateList (x:xa) = abs (x) : updateList xa

-- This section handles the Input/Output and can be used as it is. Do not modify it.
main = do
	inputdata <- getContents
	mapM_ putStrLn $ map show $ updateList $ map (read :: String -> Int) $ lines inputdata
```
