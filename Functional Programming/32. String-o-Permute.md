# String-o-Permute

Kazama gave Shaun a string of even length, and asked him to swap the characters at the even positions with the next character. Indexing starts at `0`.

Formally, given a string str of length `L` where `L` is even, Shaun has to swap the characters at position `i` and `i+1`, where ![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i\in){0, 2, .., L - 2}.

For example, if str = "abcdpqrs", `L = 8 `. We have to swap the characters at positions:
{(0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7)}

So, answer will be "badcqpsr".

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `T`, the number of test cases.
`T` lines follow, each containing some string str.

## Output Format

For each test case, print the new string as explained in the problem statement.

## Constraints

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1%20\leq%20T\leq%2010)

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1%20<%20L\leq%2010^5)


`L` is even
str consists of lowercase English characters, {a - z}.

## Sample Input

    2
    abcdpqrs
    az
## Sample Output

    badcqpsr
    za
## Explanation

**Test case #00:** This is the same example as mentioned in the problem statement.
**Test case #01:** Here `L` is `2`, so we have to swap the characters at position `(0,1)` only.

## Code

```haskell
import Control.Monad
import Data.List

main :: IO ()
main = do
    numberOfTestCase <- fmap (read::String->Int) getLine
    forM_ [1..numberOfTestCase] (\_ -> do
        input <- getLine
        putStrLn $ oPermute input)

pairList :: [b] -> [(b, b)]
pairList [] = []
pairList (x:y:xa) = (x,y) : pairList xa

swap :: (b, a) -> (a, b)
swap (a,b) = (b,a)

concatChar :: (a, a) -> [a]
concatChar (a,b) = [a] ++ [b]

oPermute :: [a] -> [a]
oPermute input = concat $ map concatChar $ map swap $ pairList input
