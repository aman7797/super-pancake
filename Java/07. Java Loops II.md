# Java Loops II

We use the integers , , and  to create the following series:

You are given  queries in the form of , , and . For each query, print the series corresponding to the given , , and  values as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of queries.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective , , and  values for that query.

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of  space-separated integers.

## Sample Input

    2
    0 2 10
    5 3 5
## Sample Output

    2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
    8 14 26 50 98

## Explanation

We have two queries:

1. We use a=0, b=2, and n=10 to produce some series s0,s1......sn-1:
    - s0 = 0+1.2 = 2
    - s1 = 0+1.2+2.2=6
    - s2 = 0+1.2+2.2+4.2=14

... and so on.

Once we hit n=10, we print the first ten terms as a single line of space-separated integers.

2. We use a=5, b=3, and n=5 to produce some series s0,s1......sn-1:

    - s0 = 5+1.3 = 8
    - s1 = 5+1.3+2.3 = 14
    - s3 = 5+1.3+2.3+4.3+8.3 = 26
    - s4 = 5+1.3+2.3+4.3+8.3+16.3 = 98
We then print each element of our series as a single line of space-separated values.
