## What is Container

Container are a set of one or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. They provide many of the same benefits as a Virtual Machines

1. *Low Hardware Footprint* - Use Operating System internal features, such as groups and namespace to create an isolated environment, minimizing CPU and memory overhead.
2. *Quick and Reusable Deployment* - Containers deploy quickly because there is no need to install the entire underlying operating system. Using an image for creating multiple containers from the same blueprint.
3. *Environment Isolation* - Container work in a closed environment where changes made on the host OS or other applications do not affect the container.
4. *Multiple Environment Deployment* - In a traditional deployment,any environment differences could break the application. With containers, all application dependencies and environment settings are encapsulated in the container image.
