# Top Earners

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly `salary*month` worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the **Employee** table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as `2` space-separated integers.

## Input Format

The **Employee** table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

![Employee](img/employee_table.png)

where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is the their monthly salary.

## Sample Input

![Employee](img/employee_details.png)

## Sample Output

    69952 1
## Explanation

The table and earnings data is depicted in the following diagram: 

The maximum earnings value is `69952`. The only employee with earnings `=69952` is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value (69952) and a count of the number of employees who have earned `$69952` (which is `1`) as two space-separated values.

## Code

```sql
SELECT MAX(SALARY*MONTHS), COUNT(*)
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE (SALARY*MONTHS) = (SELECT MAX(SALARY*MONTHS)
                         FROM EMPLOYEE);
```

(SALARY`*`MONTHS) checking all the salary`*`month with the Maximum (SALARY*MONTHS) from employee table
