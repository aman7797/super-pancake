## Sample Output

    Ashley
    Julia
    Belvet
## Explanation

Only Ashley, Julia, and Belvet have Marks > `75`. If you look at the last three characters of each of their names, there are no duplicates and 'ley' < 'lia' < 'vet'.

## Code

```sql
SELECT Name FROM STUDENTS
WHERE Marks > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(Name, 3), ID;
```
- `RIGHT()` - function extracts a number of characters from a string (starting from right).
