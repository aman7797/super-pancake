# Weather Observation Station 19
Consider `P1(a,c)` and `P2(b,d)` to be two points on a 2D plane where `(a,b)` are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and `(c,d)` are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points `P1` and `P2` and format your answer to display `4` decimal digits.

## Input Format

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

![Station](img/Station.jpg)

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

## Code

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POWER(MIN(LAT_N)-MAX(LAT_N),2)+POWER(MIN(LONG_W)-MAX(LONG_W),2)),4)
FROM STATION;
```

-/(p1-p2)^2+(q1-q2)^2
