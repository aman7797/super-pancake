# Sorting

Sorting refers to the operation or technique of arranging and rearranging sets of data in some specific order.

Consider an array;

```java
int A[10] = { 5, 4, 10, 2, 30, 45, 34, 14, 18, 9 )
```

The Array sorted in ascending order will be given as;

```java
A[] = { 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 18, 30, 34, 45 }
```
