# Programming Assignment: Programming Assignment 1: Sum of Two Digits

## Instruction
In this very first programming challenge, your goal is to implement a program that reads two digits from the standard input and prints their sum to the standard output. We start from this simple problem to show you the pipeline of submitting a solution to the grading system. In particular, the folder week1_programming_challenges/1_sum_of_two_digits in the following archive file contains solutions to this problem in various programming languages. Select the solution in your favourite programming language and submit it under the "My submission" tab. More details on the submission process are given in Sum of Two Digits section of the file week1_programming_challenges/week1_programming_challenges.pdf in the same archive file.

The archive file with all the statements and starters is available from a separate page (that can be found at the left pane under Resources): https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/resources/3r3Mv
